farmOS includes some default CSV importers with standard templates, but
sometimes you need something more custom. If you want to be able to import an
existing CSV with different headers, or go beyond what the default importers can
do, that is possible in a custom module. farmOS leverages Drupal's Migrate API
to enable complex ETL (extract, transform, and load) logic and process
pipelines. In this video we explain the basic concepts by walking through the
process of creating a simple custom importer.

This video was recorded during the weekly farmOS dev call on March 21st, 2024.
