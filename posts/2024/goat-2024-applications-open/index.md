# GOAT 2024 Application is LIVE through 8/30

(This is a repost from the [GOAT](https://goatech.org/) mailing list.)

Hello GOAT Community!

[GOAT 2024](https://goatech.org/2024/07/08/goat-2024/) is back and will take
place during the week of Sunday, November 3rd through Friday, November 8th at
[Paicines Ranch](https://paicinesranch.com/) in Paicines, California. The
beautiful Paicines Ranch is located about 60 miles south of San Jose, and we
will arrange shuttles for folks to get to/from the venue.

Since 2018, GOAT has brought together a diverse range of practitioners -
including farmers, designers, agronomists, activists, and researchers - to
advocate for more accessible software and hardware with full control going to
the farmers, eaters, and everyday users. The gathering is mostly in the format
of an "unconference," where the majority of sessions are created and scheduled
by the participants on-site when they first arrive. Topics can vary from
software architecture and farming practices to algorithmic justice and climate
resilience. Take a look on the forum under the
[#session](https://forum.goatech.org/tag/session) tag for examples of past
sessions.

[The application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScl0-aO2Ip28OIKR5l3g0CyZjgaIgrsaG3IHRsxFk4eR9AfTA/closedform)
for 2024's gathering is LIVE and will be open until August 30th. Applicants
will be notified by September 13th of their acceptance and will have until
September 27th to register for the conference.

*&ast; please note that the general election is happening during the GOAT conference,
we encourage everyone to make absentee or early voting plans!*

Sincerely,
\
GOAT Herders 2024
